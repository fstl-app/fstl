# fstl

`fstl` is a very fast [.stl file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_\(file_format\)) viewer.

It was originally written by [Matt Keeter](https://mattkeeter.com),
and is now primarily maintained by [@DeveloperPaul123](https://github.com/DeveloperPaul123).

It is designed to quickly load and render very high-polygon models;
showing 2 million triangles at 60+ FPS on a mid-range laptop.

For more details, see the [project page](http://mattkeeter.com/projects/fstl).

Issues and minor pull requests are welcome;
the project is under 1K lines of code and should be fairly approachable.

## Setting `fstl` as the Default STL Viewer

### Windows

1. Right-click an STL file
2. Select `Open With` >>> `Choose another app`
3. Select `More Apps` and `Look for another app on this PC`
4. Enter the path to the `fstl` EXE file

### MacOS

1. Ctrl+click an STL file
2. Select `Get Info`
3. Navigate to the `Open with` section
4. Select `fstl` in the dropdown
5. Click `Change All`

### Linux

If `mimeopen` is available on your system, it can be used to set `fstl` as the default viewer for STL files.
Run the following in your terminal:

```bash
# replace example.stl with an actual file
mimeopen -d example.stl
```

The following output will result:

```
Please choose a default application for files of type model/stl

	1) Other...

use application #
```

Select the `Other` option and type `fstl` as the desired command to open STL files.
This will now become the system default, even when opening files from the file manager.

## Building

The only dependency for `fstl` is [Qt 5](https://www.qt.io).

### macOS

Install Qt from their website or [Homebrew](brew.sh),
making sure `qmake` is on your shell's path.

Then, run through the following set of commands in a shell:

```
git clone https://github.com/fstl-app/fstl
cd fstl
mkdir build
cd build
qmake ../qt/fstl.pro
make -j8
./fstl.app/Contents/MacOS/fstl
```

To package a standalone app, go to the app directory and run `package.sh`

```
cd ../app
./package.sh
```

This should produce two new files in the root directory:
- `fstl.app` is a standalone application that can be copied to `/Applications`
- `fstl.dmg` is a disk image that can be given to a friend

### Linux

Install Qt with your distro's package manager (required libraries are Core, Gui,
Widgets and OpenGL, e.g. `qt5-default` and `libqt5opengl5-dev` on Debian).

You can build fstl with CMake:
```
git clone https://github.com/fstl-app/fstl
cd fstl
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
./fstl
```
